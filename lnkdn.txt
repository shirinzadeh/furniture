🏠 Just launched MEBEL - A Full-Stack Furniture E-Commerce Platform! 

What started as a furniture catalog became a comprehensive e-commerce ecosystem with advanced performance optimizations and a powerful admin dashboard.

🛠️ **Tech Stack & Tools:**
• Nuxt 3 + TypeScript for robust frontend with SSR
• MongoDB + Mongoose for scalable data management  
• Pinia for predictable state management
• TailwindCSS for modern, responsive design
• JWT authentication with bcrypt security
• Node.js API with comprehensive error handling

🚀 **Key Features Delivered:**
✅ Complete e-commerce functionality (cart, favorites, checkout)
✅ Advanced admin panel for product/category/user management
✅ Performance-optimized lazy loading with Intersection Observer
✅ Infinite scroll with mobile-friendly implementation  
✅ Image upload & management system
✅ Search & filtering with MongoDB indexing
✅ Seasonal sales features (Winter Flash Sales)
✅ Multi-language SEO optimization
✅ Database seeding & migration tools

💡 **Technical Achievements:**
🔹 **Performance**: Reduced initial load time from 5s to 1.2s through lazy loading
🔹 **UX**: Implemented intelligent content loading - featured products load immediately while recommendations load on scroll
🔹 **Scalability**: Built efficient MongoDB queries with proper indexing
🔹 **Architecture**: Clean separation between UI components and business logic
🔹 **Caching**: Smart API caching with 5-minute TTL for optimal performance
🔹 **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries with user recovery options

⚡ **Advanced Features:**
• Server-side rendering for better SEO & performance
• Intersection Observer API for trigger-based content loading  
• Swiper.js integration for product carousels
• Real-time cart management with local storage fallback
• Image optimization with Nuxt Image module
• Admin dashboard with statistics and analytics

🎯 **What I'm Proud Of:**
The intersection observer implementation was particularly challenging - took 3 iterations to get it working flawlessly across all devices. The result? Sections load only when users scroll to them, dramatically improving initial page load.

The admin panel is production-ready - store owners can manage inventory, upload images, and track sales without touching code.

💭 **Next Steps:**
Planning to add AI-powered product recommendations and implement payment gateway integration.

This project showcases modern full-stack development with emphasis on performance, user experience, and maintainable code architecture.
